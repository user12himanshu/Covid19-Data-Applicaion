## Description
A flutter application that provides data on total number of Covid 19 cases in India, various states as well as corresponding districts in India.
It has been made with flutter as it provides **Fast Development**, **Expressive and Flexible UI** and **Native Performance** in developing cross platform apps. 

Application uses **"covid19india.org"** api to fetch data with the help of http library.

Developing this application helped me in learning the concepts of **Asynchronous Programming**, **Fetching And Displaying Data from API** and **Object Oriented Programming** with *Dart*.
